This repository is a collection of **250+** R script examples. The majority of theses examples were adapted from the repos [qgis-earthengine-examples](https://github.com/giswqs/qgis-earthengine-examples) and [earthengine-py-notebooks](https://github.com/giswqs/earthengine-py-notebooks). **Would you like to contribute with your own examples?** Please open an issue [here](https://github.com/csaybar/rgee-examples/issues) attaching your reproducible script. I will upload as soon as possible to the website!
