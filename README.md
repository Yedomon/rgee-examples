# [rgee-examples](https://csaybar.github.io/rgee-examples/)
A collection of 250+ examples for [rgee](https://github.com/r-spatial/rgee), a binding package for calling Google Earth Engine from within R.

This repository is a collection of **250+** R script examples. The majority of theses examples were adapted from the repos [qgis-earthengine-examples](https://github.com/giswqs/qgis-earthengine-examples) and [earthengine-py-notebooks](https://github.com/giswqs/earthengine-py-notebooks). Acknowledgments for organizing and developing these amazing examples should always be given to Professor [Qiusheng Wu](https://wetlands.io).
